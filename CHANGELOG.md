# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed call from / call to order for incoming connections.

## [1.1.0] - 2024-10-17

### Added

### Changed

- Handle data associated with S frames. Some S frames (XID, TEST) have

  the text to the client; also passing the data will require an API change,
  which will happen in the next major release.
